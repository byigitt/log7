# Phase 23: Presence Event Handlers

## Commit: `feat(events): add presence handlers`

## Events
- presenceUpdate - User status/activity changed
- typingStart - User started typing

## Note
These events can be very spammy. Users should be careful when enabling.

## Embed info
- For presence: user, old status vs new status, activity
- For typing: user, channel
